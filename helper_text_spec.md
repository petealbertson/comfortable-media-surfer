# CMS Helper Text Feature Specification

## Overview
This document details the specifications for implementing a helper text feature in the CMS. The feature allows site administrators and content managers to add inline helper text to each CMS field when part of a layout.

## Features
- **Inline Declaration**: Field declarations include a `helper` parameter.
  - Example: `{{ cms:text headline helper:"Helper text here" }}`
- **Supported Field Types**: All field types (text, textarea, image, etc.) are supported.

## Presentation in CMS Edit Interface
- Helper text should appear beneath the CMS input field.
- Utilize Bootstrap 4 helper classes (e.g., `text-muted`) to style the text in a small, gray font.
  - Example Markup: `<p class="text-muted">Helper text here</p>` or `<div class="text-muted">Helper text here</div>`.
- The helper text is exclusively for the CMS edit interface, not for the published front end of the site.

## Validation & Data Handling
- **Character Limit**: Helper text must not exceed 240 characters.
  - If the helper text exceeds 240 characters, it should be truncated when parsing layout content.
  - An ellipsis (`â€¦`) is appended to indicate truncation.
- **Parsing Logic**: Truncation and enforcement of the character limit occur in the layout parser when extracting the `helper` parameter.

## Architecture & Implementation
- **CMS Parser Enhancements**: Update the layout parser to recognize and process the inline `helper` parameter.
- **Parser & Truncation Logic**: In the layout parser, apply truncation logic when extracting the helper parameter, enforcing the 240-character limit and appending an ellipsis if needed.
- **Styling in the CMS Edit Interface**: Render helper text using appropriate Bootstrap 4 classes to achieve the desired appearance.

## Error Handling Strategies
- Automatically truncate any helper text exceeding 240 characters and append an ellipsis without blocking the parsing operation.
- Log a warning message (if applicable) for instances of truncation for further review by developers, but do not interrupt user workflow.
- Ensure that any errors related to helper text processing do not impact the handling of other CMS fields.

## Testing Plan
### Unit Tests
- Verify that the layout parser correctly extracts the helper text parameter from inline declarations.
- Test that helper text longer than 240 characters is properly truncated with an ellipsis appended.

### Integration Tests
- Confirm that the CMS edit interface displays the helper text using the correct styling (Bootstrap 4 `text-muted`) beneath the field input.
- Verify that the helper text does not appear on the public-facing front end.

### Edge Cases
- Test with helper text exactly at 240 characters.
- Test with helper text exceeding 240 characters by just a few characters and by a large margin.

### Manual UI Testing
- Perform manual tests in the CMS to ensure content managers see the helper text as expected when adding or editing content fields.
- Validate that the truncation is applied correctly and that the UI displays the ellipsis where appropriate.

## Summary
This specification outlines the implementation of a helper text feature that provides inline guidance to content managers in the CMS. The approach includes an inline declaration format, parser truncation logic, dedicated styling using Bootstrap, and comprehensive error handling and testing strategies. This document should serve as a clear blueprint for developers to begin implementing and integrating this feature into the CMS.
