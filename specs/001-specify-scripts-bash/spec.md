# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Public page render without N+1 (Priority: P1)

As a host app developer, I want public CMS page requests to avoid N+1 queries so page loads are
consistent and fast by default, without configuration.

**Why this priority**: Public traffic is the highest volume; eliminating N+1s here yields the
largest performance gains for all adopters.

**Independent Test**: Load a CMS page by path in development with query warning tooling enabled.
No N+1 warnings are produced, and total queries remain stable regardless of page depth/structure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a published page with a layout and multiple fragments (including file attachments),
   When requesting the page by path,
   Then no N+1 query warnings are emitted and the page renders successfully.
2. Given a page that falls back to a not-found handler,
   When requesting an unknown path,
   Then no N+1 query warnings occur during fallback rendering.

### User Story 2 - Admin pages tree without N+1 (Priority: P2)

As an administrator, I want the Pages index/tree view to load without N+1 queries so navigation is
snappy even on large sites.

**Why this priority**: The pages tree and listing are common admin entry points; N+1s here degrade
UX for content editors.

**Independent Test**: Load the admin pages index/tree for a site with many pages. No N+1 warnings
are produced when rendering labels, URLs, and hierarchy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given many pages across multiple levels,
   When loading the admin pages index/tree,
   Then no N+1 warnings occur while rendering page URLs and hierarchy.

### User Story 3 - Helper-driven views remain efficient (Priority: P3)

As a host app developer using helper methods in app layouts, I want typical helper usage to avoid
N+1 queries so I donâ€™t need to hand-tune every view.

**Why this priority**: Many apps mix CMS content into app layouts; reasonable defaults should keep
query behavior efficient.

**Independent Test**: Render an app view that calls common content helpers for a single page.
No N+1 warnings are produced and attached assets are available without extra per-fragment queries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a page with several fragments including attached files,
   When rendering an app view that accesses fragment values,
   Then no N+1 warnings occur and assets resolve without extra per-fragment queries.

### Edge Cases

- Pages with many fragments and multiple file attachments
- Pages with translations enabled
- Requests for non-existent paths and 404 fallback flows
- Draft vs. published content in development vs. production
- Deep page hierarchies where parent/site data is referenced in views

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: The engine MUST provide non-breaking defaults that eliminate N+1 queries in public page
  lookups where layouts, fragments, attachments, and related metadata are accessed during render.
- FR-002: The engine MUST eliminate N+1 queries in common admin listings (including the pages
  index/tree) where page URLs, site references, or hierarchy are displayed.
- FR-003: The engine MUST ensure typical helper-driven views for a single page do not produce N+1
  queries when accessing common content and attachments.
- FR-004: The engine MUST maintain cache correctness by preferring pre-rendered content when
  appropriate and MUST avoid polluting persisted caches with request-specific overrides.
- FR-005: Default behaviors MUST be opt-out only when safety requires it; otherwise defaults SHOULD
  be always-on so host apps benefit without configuration.
- FR-006: Tests and manual validation steps MUST verify that the specified scenarios do not produce
  N+1 warnings and that core page rendering remains correct.
- FR-007: Changes MUST NOT introduce breaking API or behavioral changes for host applications within
  this feature scope.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- Page: The primary content object tied to a layout and fragments.
- Layout: Defines the page structure and how content is assembled.
- Fragment: Units of content associated to a page; may include file attachments.
- Attachment: Binary assets linked to fragments and used in rendering.
- Site: Container that scopes pages, layouts, and URLs.
- Admin Pages Index/Tree: Listing and hierarchical view of pages for editors.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- SC-001: In development with query warning tooling enabled, the public page render path produces
  zero N+1 warnings for the defined P1 scenario.
- SC-002: The admin pages index/tree produces zero N+1 warnings for the defined P2 scenario.
- SC-003: For a representative page with multiple fragments and attachments, total query count is
  stable and does not increase linearly with the number of fragments.
- SC-004: Page render time (server-side) improves or remains equal compared to baseline while
  meeting SC-001 and SC-002; no regressions in render correctness are observed during validation.
