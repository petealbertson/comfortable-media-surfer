# Specification Quality Checklist: N+1 Performance Quick Wins

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: /Users/petealbertson/Projects/comfortable-media-surfer/specs/001-specify-scripts-bash/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

All items PASS. The spec defines clear user stories (public render, admin index, helper usage), edge cases,
functional requirements focused on eliminating N+1s without breaking behavior, and measurable success criteria.

## Notes

- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` for design and research.
